# Avalara Vector Semantic Discovery

An interactive educational visualization that demonstrates how vector embeddings and cosine similarity work in semantic search. Perfect for understanding the mathematics behind modern AI search, RAG systems, and content relevance.

## 🎯 What This Does

This tool lets you **explore semantic space** by dragging a vector around and watching relevant terms "discover" themselves when your vector points in their direction. It's a hands-on way to understand:

- How semantic embeddings represent meaning as geometric positions
- Why cosine similarity measures the angle between vectors
- How all vectors originate from a common origin point (0,0)
- The relationship between vector angle and semantic similarity

## 🚀 Try It Live

## 📚 How to Use

1. **Origin (0,0)**: The black dot at canvas center represents the geometric reference point
2. **Blue Vector A**: Fixed vector pointing to "sales tax" semantic position
3. **Red Vector B**: Drag its endpoint to explore semantic space
4. **Discovery**: Terms appear when Vector B points near their true semantic positions
5. **Angle & Similarity**: Watch how the angle between vectors determines similarity scores

## 💡 Why This Matters

Understanding vector geometry is crucial for:
- **Search Optimization**: Know how search engines match queries to content
- **RAG Systems**: Build better retrieval-augmented generation pipelines
- **Content Strategy**: Understand semantic relationships in your content
- **AI Applications**: Grasp the fundamentals of embedding-based systems

## 🎓 Educational Use

This visualization is ideal for:
- Teaching semantic search concepts to marketing teams
- Explaining vector databases to stakeholders
- Training content teams on AI-powered search
- Learning the math behind cosine similarity

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Embeddings**: Uses actual semantic embeddings from tax/compliance domain
- **Visualization**: Built with D3.js for smooth, interactive graphics
- **Similarity Calculation**: Real-time cosine similarity computation
- **No Backend Required**: Runs entirely in your browser
