### Option 1: Educational Focus
```
Ever wondered how AI search *actually* works? ðŸŽ¯

I built an interactive tool that lets you explore the geometry behind semantic search.

Drag a vector around and watch relevant terms "discover" themselves when you point in their direction. It's the best way I've found to understand:

âœ“ How embeddings represent meaning as geometric positions
âœ“ Why cosine similarity measures angles between vectors  
âœ“ How RAG systems match queries to content

Perfect for anyone working in:
â€¢ SEO & content optimization
â€¢ AI/ML applications
â€¢ Search technology
â€¢ Technical education

### Option 2: Problem-Solving Focus
```
Tired of explaining "vector embeddings" to your team? ðŸ¤”

I created an interactive visualization that makes it click in 30 seconds.

Instead of equations and slides, just let them drag a vector around. When they see terms "discovering" themselves based on geometric angles, the concept becomes intuitive.

I've used this to help:
â€¢ Marketing teams understand semantic SEO
â€¢ Stakeholders grasp RAG technology  
â€¢ Content teams optimize for AI search

Also a subtle way to show off Avalara's technical depth ðŸ˜‰

### Option 3: Behind-the-Scenes
```
Built something fun over the weekend ðŸš€

An interactive tool that visualizes how semantic search works at the vector level.

The insight: Search isn't about keyword matching anymore. It's about measuring angles between vectors in high-dimensional space.

This tool lets you explore that concept by dragging vectors and watching semantic relationships reveal themselves in real-time.

Great for understanding:
â€¢ How Google/AI search matches queries to content
â€¢ Why "semantic similarity" isn't magic
â€¢ What your content optimization is actually doing

## Twitter/X Post Suggestions

### Short & Punchy
```
Want to understand how AI search *really* works?

I built an interactive tool that lets you drag vectors and watch semantic relationships reveal themselves.

No equations. No jargon. Just geometric intuition.

### Educational Thread Starter
```
ðŸ§µ How does semantic search actually work?

Let me show you with an interactive tool I built.

The key insight: Your content and queries become vectors (arrows in geometric space). Search engines measure the *angle* between them.

Small angle = high relevance.

## Video Demo Script (30-60 seconds)

### Hook (0-5 seconds)
"Want to see how AI search actually works under the hood?"

### Demo (5-40 seconds)
- Show dragging the red vector
- Point out terms discovering themselves
- Highlight the angle/similarity changing
- Show the discovery counter increasing

### Key Points to Mention:
- "All vectors start from the origin"
- "The angle between vectors determines similarity"
- "This is exactly how RAG and semantic search work"

### Call to Action (40-60 seconds)
"Link in comments - try it yourself. No download needed, runs in your browser."
"Built at Avalara where we're applying this tech to tax compliance."

## Best Practices

### Timing
- **Best days**: Tuesday-Thursday
- **Best times**: 8-10 AM or 12-2 PM (your timezone)
- Post on LinkedIn first, then Twitter a few hours later

### Hashtags
LinkedIn (use 3-5):
- #SemanticSearch
- #AI or #MachineLearning
- #SEO or #ContentStrategy
- #VectorDatabases
- #TechEducation

Twitter (use 2-3):
- #SemanticSearch
- #AI
- #MachineLearning

### Engagement Strategy
1. Reply to every comment within the first 2 hours
2. Tag relevant people/companies if they engage
3. Share in relevant Slack communities
4. Consider posting in SEO-focused LinkedIn groups

### Communities to Share In
- SEO Signals Lab (Facebook)
- Women in Tech SEO (Slack)
- r/TechSEO (Reddit)
- r/MachineLearning (Reddit)
- SEO-focused Slack channels

## Screenshot/GIF Recommendations

If you want to include a preview image, capture:
1. The initial state with both vectors visible
2. A moment where several terms are discovered
3. The angle/similarity metrics visible

Tool recommendations:
- **GIF**: ScreenToGif (Windows) - perfect for LinkedIn
- **Video**: OBS Studio or Windows Game Bar
- **Screenshot**: Windows Snipping Tool

## After You Post

1. Pin the post to your LinkedIn profile for a week
2. Add the link to your LinkedIn Featured section
3. Reference it in future posts about semantic search
4. Consider writing a longer LinkedIn article explaining the concepts
